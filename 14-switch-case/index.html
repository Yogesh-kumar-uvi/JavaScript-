<h1>what is switch case </h1>
<p>In simple terms, a switch statement in JavaScript is a way to check a value against different options and run specific code depending on which option matches. It's like a menu where you pick an option and get the result based on your choice.</p>

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Switch Case</th>
            <th>If-Else</th>
        </tr>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Used for comparing a single value against multiple discrete options.</td>
            <td>Used for handling complex conditions, ranges, or multiple expressions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Uses strict equality (`===`) for comparisons.</td>
            <td>Supports various conditions with logical operators and ranges.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>More readable and organized when dealing with multiple fixed options.</td>
            <td>Can become harder to read with many `else if` conditions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Faster in some cases due to optimization in JavaScript engines (e.g., jump tables).</td>
            <td>May be slower for many conditions because all `if` conditions are evaluated sequentially.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Works well when checking a single variable or expression.</td>
            <td>Works well for checking multiple variables, ranges, or logical expressions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Requires a `break` statement to avoid fall-through behavior.</td>
            <td>Does not require `break` as each block executes independently.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cannot handle ranges directly (e.g., `age >= 18 && age <= 25`).</td>
            <td>Can handle ranges and logical conditions easily.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Includes an optional `default` case for unmatched conditions.</td>
            <td>Includes an optional `else` block for unmatched conditions.</td>
